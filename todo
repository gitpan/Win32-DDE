Get under RCS control.

Look at the Win32::DDE::Client AUTOLOAD to make some variables readonly, also
fix for bad $self (to handle Win32::DDE::BadCall correctly).

look harder at where the dde initialize gets done; Gurusamy Sarathy suggested
putting it into the DllMain like Win32::OLE does; need to figure out how to
handle errors then...

Fix the makefile to not delete server.exe when a make clean gets done.

develop a better server to test against. Something that will reject bad
commands would be real nice.

look at doing server .pm code (probably will need to work on
Win32::DDE::Callback). Using Tie::Watch looks promising.

look at advise code; develop an example of 'hot' and 'warm' DDE. Again,
Win32::DDE::Callback probably needs work.
