This package is currently the Win32::DDE::Client class, and the supporting
Win32::DDE and Win32::DDE::Callback classes. Only 'cold' DDE is currently
written and tested; I think there is enough .xs code to support 'warm' and
'hot' DDE, as well as a DDE server.

I am only currently providing binary for Perl 5.004; the provided binaries 
will NOT work with ActiveState's Perl, and I don't know if the code is 
source compatible.

If you want to help with warm/hot DDE, Win32::DDE::Server, or an ActiveState
port, let me know so we don't duplicate effort.

This code was originally lying around on www.hip.com in an unsupported
directory; Doug Breshears was the original author, and I can't seem to find any
email address for him; Gurusamy Sarathy <gsar@umich.edu> converted the .xs code
from a 16 bit version to a 32 bit version, and I provided the updated .pm
files, POD, test script, Makefile.PL, code 'cleanup' (mostly insertion of
underscores) and the other junk.

To test, run one copy of server.exe, then run the test.pl script; it should run
all tests correctly, and the server.exe should put a dialog box up when the
Execute command in test.pl runs.  If you run multiple copies, some tests will
fail.
